## About
Next war is a hex and counter, strategy wargame played on a tabletop. The game seeks to simulate potential near-future conflicts via the use of detailed models that mimic realworld combat in the 21st century. This web app aims to recreate that board game as a modern single-page-application web app, to facilitate online play and easier learning of the (extremely) complex rules.

For those new to the Next War series, rules can be found on the publishers website (GMT Games)
